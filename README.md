<!-- PROJECT SHIELDS -->
<!--
*** I'm using markdown "reference style" links for readability.
*** Reference links are enclosed in brackets [ ] instead of parentheses ( ).
*** See the bottom of this document for the declaration of the reference variables
*** for contributors-url, forks-url, etc. This is an optional, concise syntax you may use.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Everest

![Screenshot](screenshots/screenshot.jpg)

Studying with your own notes may end up being inefficient because you may not know what topics are important or related to each other. This lack of clarity often leads to information overload and struggles with retention. Our inspiration stems from the need to simplify the learning process, making it easier to identify key information and relationships between topics.

Everest is a modern note-taking / study app with three main features:
- Quickly summarizing notes using AI
- Generating flashcards with AI
- Uploading PDF and image files so you can upload raw lecture slides or handwritten notes.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB Atlas
- Google Cloud
- Next.js
- Typescript
- tRPC
- Google PaLM 2
- Google Vision AI
- Uploadthing
